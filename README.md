## __Experiments with GivEnergy API for Smart Plugs__

There is a wiki giving context about this project here https://github.com/V999TEC/GivEnergyPlugs/wiki/The-Home-of-Icarus  

The main problem with the GE API to GET datapoints for a smart-device is that it does not currently support a 'from' or 'to'  date/time range.
For the client application it means that potentially several pages needs to be scanned until the required time range is covered.

This java code creates a cache in uuid.tmp which reflects the timestamp and power readings for each datapoint.
Subsequent requests will maintain the cache while minimising the traffic needed against the GE API for smart plugs.


Latest snapshot plugs.jar in __/download/__ or choose release version

### See download folder for wrapper scripts and latest snapshot prebuilt jar
Or see https://github.com/V999TEC/GivEnergyPlugs/releases  
for complete source code & release version of __plugs.jar__

### Syntax

```java -jar plugs.jar property_file_name  [alias [from_timestamp [to_timestamp]]]```

### Usage
Define a property file (such as __My.properties__) for your smart devices containing your generated api:smart-device token for example:

```
smart-device=insert_api_token_here
```
You can generate a GivEnergy API token for your api:smart-device here https://givenergy.cloud/account-settings/security


Check you API token is good by enumerating all the smart devices as follows
```java -jar plugs.jar My.properties```

```
PlugA=08f6b4f9-0000-4d41-0000-95214d78e740
PlugB=aba03ce8-0000-41f9-0000-91876bb0cd45
PlugC=bb1c988e-0000-4ad5-0000-53c5a99f5841
PlugD=76412d97-0000-4ac0-0000-238ed1e1a6e2
plug\ E=9cc9b483-0000-44ff-0000-1c47395fbc67
```

Edit the property file and paste the results so that the alias can be used on subsequent requests

```
smart-device=insert_api_token_here
# list the smart device alias and ids 
PlugA=08f6b4f9-0000-4d41-0000-95214d78e740
PlugB=aba03ce8-0000-41f9-0000-91876bb0cd45
PlugC=bb1c988e-0000-4ad5-0000-53c5a99f5841
etc
```

N.B.
If the alias name contains spaces, it will be escaped in the properties file.  
So, for instance, __Washing Machine__ would become __Washing\ Machine=uuid__

Also, when passing parameters containing spaces to the jar, be sure to put them in quotes:

```java -jar plugs.jar My.properties "Washing Machine"```


### Example 1   
Analyse consumption for a device with an alias defined in My.properties for the specified timespan
 
```java -jar plugs.jar My.properties "plug E" 2023-10-01T05:59:06Z 2023-10-01T06:15:00Z```
```
